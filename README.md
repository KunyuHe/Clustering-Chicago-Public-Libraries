# Clustering-Chicago-Public-Libraries
In this project, I clustered 80 public libraries in the city of Chicago with NMF, based on the categories of their top five venues nearby. It would be a nice guide for those who would like to spend their days in these libraries, exploring their surroundings, but become tired of staying in only one or few of them over time. Check a map of these clustered libraries in the last section and pick up those surrounded by your favorite category of venues, pay them a visit during their hours of operation!
